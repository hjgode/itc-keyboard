#summary An extended ITC keyboard remapper API (compact framework) class

= Introduction =

ITC provides you the keyboard remap API within the device resource kit. This API is good to remap keys to produce
simply other key messages. But as soon as you need to remap a key to produce special keys, you need to fiddle
with the registry. For example you can not use the remap API to produce a sequence of keys or toggle key modifiers like CAPS lock or CTRL.
This is the time where you may need this keyboard remapper class.
